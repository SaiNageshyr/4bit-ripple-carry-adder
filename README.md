# 4bit-ripple-carry-adder
A 4 bit Carry Ripple Adder is a type of circuit that is utilized for the purpose of adding two 4 bit numbers together. Its functionality involves the addition of bits, 
where the sum and carry out of each bit are influenced by the preceding bit. Consequently there is an effect observed since the carry, from one bit affects 
the addition process of the bit. Although it is relatively straightforward to create this type of adder can become slower when dealing with sequences of bits due, 
to the time it takes for carry bits to propagate through the circuit.
